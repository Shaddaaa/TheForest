TIME:
20 ticks per second (20tps)

CURRENCY:
trees
wood
coal

-------
TRESS:

GROWTH:
trees added each tick = log base n of trees
trees += logBASEn(trees) * c

trees burn down each tick
trees-=percentage*chance*trees

GROWTH-UGPRADES:
constant multiplier c
lower burn chance
lower burn percentage

-------
ANIMALS:
boost forest growth by composting

BOOST:
multiply growth with animals+1

GROWTH:
animals grow until they hit an amount dependent on the amount of trees

diff = limit - current
diff ALWAYS has to be greater than or equal to the growth, so that current + growth is never greater than limit
growth = 0.2 * diff
after n ticks we will be at:
diff = 0.8^n * diff

GRWOTH-UPGRADES:
constant multiplier c to maximum animals
increase replicate chance
