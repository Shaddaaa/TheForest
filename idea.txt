TIME:
20 ticks per second (20tps)

CURRENCY:
trees
wood
coal

GROWTH:
trees added each tick = log base n of trees
trees += logBASEn(trees)

trees burn down based on chance
if(chance) trees-=percentage*trees

GROWTH-UGPRADES:
constant multiplier c
lower logarithm base n
lower burn chance
lower burn percentage
